2. Roulette game [script](roulette.sh) with techniques [Martingale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martingale_(betting_system)) and [reverseLabrouchere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labouch%C3%A8re_system#Reverse_Labouch%C3%A8re)

```
USAGE:
./roulette.sh -m money -t technique

OPTIONS:
    -m    Set money to play
    -t    Set techinique to play (martingale / reverseLabrouchere)
```

3. Custom implementation of `grep` functionality in Bash [script](grep.sh).

	-n print line number with output lines
	-l print only names of FILEs with selected lines
	-i ignore case distinctions in patterns and data
	-v select non-matching lines
```

4. Implement basic list operations.
From [exercism](https://github.com/exercism/bash/tree/main/exercises/practice/list-ops)

	* `append` (given two lists, add all items in the second list to the end of the first list);
    * `concatenate` (given a series of lists, combine all items in all lists into one flattened list);
    * `filter` (given a predicate and a list, return the list of all items for which predicate(item) is True);
    * `length` (given a list, return the total number of items within it);
    * `map` (given a function and a list, return the list of the results of applying function(item) on all items);
    * `foldl` (given a function, a list, and initial accumulator, fold (reduce) each item into the accumulator from the left using function(accumulator, item));
    * `foldr` (given a function, a list, and an initial accumulator, fold (reduce) each item into the accumulator from the right using function(item, accumulator));
    * `reverse` (given a list, return a list with all the original items, but in reversed order);
