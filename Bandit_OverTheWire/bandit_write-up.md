```

## Level 3
- Password Location: password is stored inside a **hidden** file within the "inhere" directory.
- Useful information: `man ls`

Posible solutions:

```
bandit3@bandit:~/inhere$ ls -la
total 12
drwxr-xr-x 2 root    root    4096 Apr 23 18:04 .
drwxr-xr-x 3 root    root    4096 Apr 23 18:04 ..

```
(We only found a file of type ASCII text, which means that it is human-readable)

One liner: 

```
$ file ./* | grep ASCII | head -n 1 | awk '{print $1}' FS=':' | xargs cat
